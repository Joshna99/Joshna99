# 👩‍💻 Data Explorer & Visualization Enthusiast 📊✨

👋 Hello, I'm Joshna Maligireddy, a passionate data enthusiast with a keen interest in data visualization. I thrive on transforming raw data into meaningful insights that tell compelling stories. I am actively seeking opportunities in the field of data visualization to contribute my skills and creativity.

## 🧙‍♂️ Skills and Spells

- 📊 **Data Analysis Tools**: Conjuring insights with Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib), and SQL.
- 📈 **Visualization Wands**: Crafting stories with Tableau and PowerBI.

## ✨ Fun Projects

Check out some of the cool projects I've been cooking up:

- **Heart Attack Prediction using Classification and Regression** 🚀 :  The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can help identify individuals at a higher risk of heart disease. By analyzing a dataset of health parameters, we aim to build accurate models that can assist in early detection and intervention.
- **Vegetable Recognition using CNN** 🌟 : The goal of this research is to create a reliable and efficient vegetable detection system using computer vision and CNN. Pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification are the three key steps.
- **Live Face Mask Detector** 💡 : This project is a foray into the blend of public health and technology. In an era where face masks have become essential, this real-time detector uses CNN and OpenCV to discern between masked and unmasked faces. It's a story of bridging computer vision and societal safety, contributing to the efforts against health hazards.
